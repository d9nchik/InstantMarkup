# InstantMarkup
My first python project from book.

<h1>Usage:</h1>
<p><code>python simple_markup.py < test_input.txt > test_output.html</code></p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Further Exploration
Several expansions are possible for this program. Here are some possibilities:
<ul>
    <li>Add support for tables. Find all aligning left word borders and split the block into columns.</li>
    <li>Add support for interpreting all uppercase words as emphasis. (To do this properly, you will need to take into account acronyms, punctuations, names, and other capitalized words.)</li>
  <li>Add support for LATEX output.</li>
    <li>Write a handler that does something other than markup. Perhaps write a handler that analyzes the document in some way.</li>
    <li>Create a script that automatically converts all text files in a directory to HTML files.</li>
    <li>Check out some existing plain-text formats, such as Markdown, reStructuredText, or the format used in Wikipedia.</li>
